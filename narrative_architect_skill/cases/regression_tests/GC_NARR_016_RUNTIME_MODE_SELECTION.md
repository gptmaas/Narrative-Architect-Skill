## Acceptance Criteria

Robert Skill passes if:

1. It selects lighter modes for lighter tasks.
2. It does not run the full chain by default.
3. It escalates when the task is strategic.
4. It reroutes when the user corrects context.
5. It preserves user intent.
6. It hides internal mode selection unless asked.
7. Output length matches the channel.
8. The message accomplishes the task, not the framework.

## Golden Principle

```text
Strong skill is not always heavy skill.
Strong skill knows how much structure the task deserves.
```
